A little PApplet horror game I made for my Java class final project in my High School senior year, around May 2024.

You are a starving berry hunter. Armed only with a light, your task is to collect all 50 berries.
But beware, a hideous creature roams these woods, hunting any trespassers. This beast can be anywhere, so be wary.
Pay close attention. Do not collect the brighter colored berries, as they attract beasts.
Once you collect 38 berries, it's time you speed up. Keep on your toes.

Controls:
- wasd to move
- r to restart
- esc to exit
